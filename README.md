# Dmitrii Zhukov — Senior DevOps / Infrastructure Engineer

Infrastructure engineer focused on **Kubernetes reliability**, **observability stacks**, and **PostgreSQL HA operations**. 19 years in tech — 14 as a .NET developer and tech lead, 6+ in DevOps and cloud infrastructure.

## What I work on

- **Kubernetes** — GKE, kubeadm, Rancher. Production clusters from 3 nodes to multi-region. On-premise included (ships with satellite connectivity — not your typical infra problem).
- **Observability** — Prometheus, Grafana, Istio service mesh with distributed tracing. SLO-based alerting using multi-window burn rate.
- **PostgreSQL** — HA clusters with Patroni, streaming replication, failover testing, performance tuning.
- **IaC** — Terraform, Ansible, Helm. Infrastructure treated the same as application code: PR reviews, tested pipelines, no manual snowflakes.
- **CI/CD** — Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Codefresh. Reduced release failure rates by 90% through pre-deployment validation and staged rollouts.

### 📊 [prometheus-alerting-rules](https://github.com/dmazhukov/prometheus-alerting-rules)
Production-grade Prometheus alerting rules for Kubernetes, PostgreSQL/Patroni, and SLO burn rate alerting — with runbooks.

Covers:
- Pod crash-loop, OOM, PVC fill-up, deployment rollout stuck
- Patroni cluster health, replication lag, XID wraparound
- Multi-window SLO burn rate (Google SRE method)
- Node disk, network, clock skew
